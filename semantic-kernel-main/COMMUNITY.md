# Welcome to the Semantic Kernel Community!

Below are some ways that you can get involved in the SK Community.

## Engage on Github

File issues, submit PRs, and provide feedback and ideas to what you'd like to see from the Semantic Kernel.
We do our best to respond to each submission.

## Public Community Office Hours

We regularly have Community Office Hours that are open to the **public** to join. 

Add Semantic Kernel events to your calendar - we're running two community calls to cater different timezones: 
* Americas timezone: download the [calendar.ics](https://aka.ms/sk-community-calendar) file.
* Asia Pacific timezone: download the [calendar-APAC.ics](https://aka.ms/sk-community-calendar-apac) file.

To keep topics organized, please submit what you'd like us to cover here:
[https://forms.office.com/r/BbXFzmmFys](https://forms.office.com/r/BbXFzmmFys)

If you are unable to make it live, all meetings will be recorded and posted online.

## Join the conversation on Discord

We have a growing and active channel on Discord where you can get help, engage in lively discussion,
and share what you've built with Semantic Kernel!
